###Writing helps me understand my thoughts.

When I'm trying to learn a new topic or tool, writing about the target subject forces me to organize my thoughts into consumable pieces. A good indication that I need to learn more about a specific area occurs when I struggle to explain what I've learned to someone else. A teacher must first learn the curriculum prior to teaching the class. This blog will be mutually beneficial for myself and for others. The blog directly helps me learn to express
myself by further developing my communication and written skills. In addition, blogging opens up what I'm learning to a broader audience for reference.

Blogging complements the "learn by doing" technique by documenting and archiving all the information I gathered for a particular topic. Whether I'm reading about the latest JavaScript micro-library or clever CSS hack, documenting which tools and techniques I've used provides an incredible resource to myself (and hopefully others).

My name is Edward Taylor and this is my blog.
