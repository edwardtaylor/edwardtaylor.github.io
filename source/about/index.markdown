Hi. 

My name is Edward and I love to code.

I've been programming for over a decade using a variety of different techniques and languages. I'm a full-stack engineer with expertise in developing enterprise solutions for the non-profit sector. I gravitate towards desiging, implementing financial-related projects and geek out to accounting and numbers.

I subscribe to Test Driven Development(TDD) and Agile/Lean methodologies. I'm a firm believer in test automation and continious delivery. Recently I've fallen in love with dynamic programming languages and meta-programming. I'm an avid hacker of new technology and trends in software development.
