Hi. 

My name is Edward and I love to code.

I've been programming for over a decade using a variety of different techniques and languages. I'm a full-stack engineer with expertise in developing enterprise solutions for the non-profit sector. I gravitate towards designing, implementing financial-related projects and geek out to accounting and numbers.

I subscribe to Test Driven Development (TDD) and Agile / Lean methodologies. I'm a firm believer in test automation and continuous delivery. Recently I've fallen in love with dynamic programming languages and meta-programming. I'm an avid hacker of new technology and trends in software development.

When away from my passion, I can normally be found palling around with my two boys. We like hitting up the beach, playing video games, and hiking in the great outdoors. My wife and I love to travel (with our boys) and see how much awesome this little rock has to offer.
